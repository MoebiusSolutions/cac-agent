Those tools are not\nJava based so we would potentially have to recompile parts of those tools\nso that their network stacks are CAC aware.\nSince, we already have CAC working with Java, we decided to create a network\ntunnel/port forwarder/relay. It turns out that creating a relay in Java\nis pretty simple.\nDetails\ncac-aware-ssl-relay-jar-with-dependencies.jar is a simple network relay.\nIt uses entries in agent.properties with the relay. prefix to configure each relay. \nThe rest of the property name is the bindHostname:bindPort. The value\nof the property is the targetHostname:targetPort to relay/forward to.\nFor example, suppose you have four CAC protected services:\n\nhttps://cac-required.git.server.org\nhttps://cac-required.mvn.server.org\nhttps://cac-required.docker.server.org\nhttps://cac-required.npm.server.org\n\nYou would add the following to your /etc/hosts file\n127.0.0.1 git-local\n127.0.0.2 mvn-local\n127.0.0.3 docker-local\n127.0.0.4 npm-local\nThen in your agent.properties you would add\nrelay.git-local\\:9090=cac-required.git.server.org:443\nrelay.mvn-local\\:9090=cac-required.mvn.server.org:443\nrelay.docker-local\\:9090=cac-required.docker.server.org:443\nrelay.npm-local\\:9090=cac-required.npm.server.org:443\nNote that the \\: is required to prevent the Java properties parser from using just\nrelay.git-local as the key instead of what we need which is relay.git-local:9090.\nNext, you would run \njava -jar target/cac-aware-ssl-relay-jar-with-dependencies.jar\nNow, you can point your development tools at your local ports:\ngit remote add relay http://git-local:9090/same/path/as/without/relay/project.git\nRunning fetch as shown below will git fetch from the CAC protected server.\nNote: Be sure the relay is running before you fetch.\ngit fetch relay\nThe above will trigger the Swing user interface to prompt for you PIN. You may also have to login\nusing the username and password you have setup on your git server (but that can be one-time\nif you have setup git to cache usernames and passwords). And, then it will fetch from the CAC\nprotected server.\nSimilarly, setup your maven repository to use http://mvn-local:9090/same/path/as/without/relay.\nNow, the next mvn download triggered will be through the relay and prompt you for your PIN\nif it needs it. Any downloads will be downloaded from the CAC protected server after the ssl-relay\nhas presented the server with your CAC identity and validated it.\nSSL Server\nYou can make the relay serve SSL sockets by adding sslRelay prefixed properties in\nin your agent.properties:\nsslRelay.docker-local\\:8443=cac-required.git.server.org:443\nBut then, you must configure a SSL key for the server. Below, a self-signed key was configured\ninto certs/me.p12, with the java default key store password. Adding these options to the java\ncommand when starting the relay configures the key:\n  java \\\n    -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStoreType=pkcs12 \\\n    -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=certs/me.p12 \\\n    \"$@\" -jar target/cac-aware-ssl-relay-jar-with-dependencies.jar;\nIf you want to auto-restart the ssl relay after an error you can use this short bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# trap ctrl-c and call ctrl_c()\ntrap ctrl_c INT\n\nfunction ctrl_c() {\n        echo \"** Trapped CTRL-C\"\n    exit 0\n}\n\nwhile true; do\n  java \\\n    -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStoreType=pkcs12 \\\n    -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=certs/me.p12 \\\n    \"$@\" -jar target/cac-aware-ssl-relay-jar-with-dependencies.jar; \ndone\n"},"Profile-Support.html":{"url":"Profile-Support.html","title":"Profile Support","keywords":"","body":"Profile Support\nIf you need to have different configurations for different servers, then profile support may help.\nWithout specifying any profile the configuration and truststore files are searched for under your\nhome folder in .moesol/cac-agent\nIf you need a different configuration you can make cac-agent search in a sub-directory\nby specifying a \"profile\" name via a system property com.moesol.agent.profile.\nFor example, if you have a different truststore, username, and password for the\nfoobar server, you can add -Dcom.moesol.agent.profile=foobar to the java options\nand cac-agent will use ~/.moesol/cac-agent/foobar as the folder for these files:\nagent.properties\npkcs11.cfg\ntruststore.jks\nConfiguration Directory Support\nIf you would rather put the configuration directory into a specific directory instead\nof having it under your home folder then you can give the absolute path to the configuration\ndirectory using the Java system property com.moesol.agent.config.
